## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript


### Useful resources

- [Creating Glow Effects with CSS](https://codersblock.com/blog/creating-glow-effects-with-css/) - This helped me create the glowing effect of the dice button. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Using the Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) - This is documentation which helped me finally understand fetching APIs. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
